## Getting Started

The most important community resources for those new to Rust are:

- [#rust-beginners][beginners_irc], an IRC channel that
  loves answering questions at any depth.
- The [Users Forum][users_forum], for discussion of all
  things Rust.

You may also find help on the question and answer site, [Stack Overflow][stack_overflow].

[stack_overflow]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rust

## News

[This Week in Rust][twir] collects the latest news, upcoming events
and a week-by-week account of changes in the Rust language and
libraries. [The Rust Blog][rust_blog] is where the Rust team makes
announcements about major developments. And nearly everything happening in
Rust is discussed on the unofficial subreddit, [/r/rust][reddit].

We also have a [Twitter][twitter] account.
If you can't read English, you can also follow our [Weibo][weibo] for Chinese.

## IRC Channels

Rustaceans maintain a number of friendly, high-traffic [IRC] channels on Mozilla's IRC network, irc.mozilla.org.

The [#rust][rust_irc] channel is a venue for general
discussion about Rust, and a good place to ask for help. You'll find
people willing to answer any questions about Rust, and
responses are typically fast.

Rust's developers coordinate in [#rust-internals][internals_irc]. It is for
real-time discussion about hacking on Rust itself. It is also the channel
to ask questions about contributing to Rust.

## Discussion Forums

We have two forums for asynchronous discussion:

- The [Users Forum][users_forum], a space for asking questions, posting code
  snippets, talking about Rust projects, and so on.

- The [Internals Forum][internals_forum], a space dedicated to design and
  implementation discussion about Rust itself (which includes Cargo, the
  standard library, and other core bits of infrastructure).

[users_forum]: https://users.rust-lang.org/
[internals_forum]: https://internals.rust-lang.org/

## YouTube Channel

Rust has a [YouTube channel][youtube_channel] where presentations
given at user groups and conferences by members of the Rust community
are uploaded.

[youtube_channel]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYhcUwRBNscFNUKTjgPFiA

## User Groups and Meetups

There are more than 90 [Rust User Groups][user_group] worldwide in
over 35 countries. Rustaceans meet periodically in Rust User Groups.
Its a great introduction to the community and a great way to learn and
socialize with other people with a similar interest. Meetings are
usually held monthly and very informal. Meetings are open to everyone.

There is a global [calendar][calendar] for keeping up with Rust events.
Contact the [community team][community_team] to add your own.

## The Rust Team

Rust has a community-driven development process where most decisions are made
through open discussion and consensus, under the stewardship of various
[teams][teams]:

* The [Core Team][core_team] is responsible for steering the design and
development process, overseeing the introduction of new features, and ultimately
making decisions for which there is no consensus (this happens rarely).

* The [Language Team][language_team] is responsible for the
  design of new language features.

* The [Library Team][library_team] is responsible for the Rust standard
library, rust-lang crates, and conventions.

* The [Compiler Team][compiler_team] is responsible for compiler internals and
optimizations.

* The [Dev tools team][dev_tools_team] is responsible for setting the overall
  direction of tools for working with Rust code.

* The [Cargo team][cargo_team] is responsible for the design and implementation of Cargo.

* The [Infrastructure Team][infra_team] is responsible for infrastructure that supports
  the project itself: CI, release generation, bots, and metrics.

* The [Community Team][community_team] is responsible for coordinating events,
outreach, commercial users, teaching materials, and exposure. They can also
direct inquiries to the correct parties when its not clear who to contact
about something Rusty.

* The [Moderation Team][mod_team] is responsible for helping to uphold the
[code of conduct][coc].

* The [Documentation Team][doc_team] is responsible for ensuring Rust has
  fantastic documentation.

In addition to the official team rosters, most teams also have a larger set
of reviewers who are knowledgeable about the area and can sign off on
code. If you're interested in getting involved in one of these teams,
feel free to reach out to the team leader or any other member, who can
help get you started.

## Rust Development

Rust has had over [2,000 different contributors][authors], a number that grows
every single week. [We'd love for you to join that list][contribute]!

As mentioned above, the [Rust Internals Forum][internals_forum] is dedicated to
discussing the design and implementation of Rust. A lot of discussion also
happens on GitHub:

- The [main repository][github] and [issue tracker][issue_tracking] are the
  front lines of the implementation work. Our reviewers strive to be friendly
  and to help mentor newcomers, so don't hesitate to open a pull request!

- The [RFC repo][rfcs] tracks our Request for Comment process, the main pathway
  through which the Rust community and the teams reach consensus on new
  features proposed for the language and official libraries and tools.
